        <h2>Al Swearengen</h2>
        <h3>Played by Ian McShane</h3>
        <p>
          The proprietor of The Gem Saloon was six months ahead of everyone else
          in Deadwood, and he runs the town like a corrupt riverboat captain. He
          knows every move that every person in town makes, anticipates problems
          and eliminates them. His girls aren't exactly the class of the town,
          but he controls the most successful bar and brothel in all of
          Deadwood—bringing in $5,000 a day in 1876—and anybody that threatens
          his sources of income may well end up fed to Mr. Wu's pigs.

        <h2>Seth Bullock</h2>
        <h3>Played by Timothy Olyphant</h3>
        <p>
          A native of Ontario and the son of a stern British sergeant-major,
          Seth Bullock left home for good at the age of 16 and ended up in
          Montana during the silver strikes of the 1860s. A natural leader, he
          held a number of elected positions in his early 20s and was eventually
          appointed Sheriff of Montana Territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having heard of the big strikes in the Black Hills, Bullock has made
          his way to Deadwood—not to prospect, but to open up a hardware
          franchise with his business partner and friend Sol Star. Veterans of
          frontier living, the two are undaunted by Deadwood’s lawless and
          dangerous nature. But Bullock has put law-enforcement behind him, and
          fully intends to make his way as a businessman.

        <h2>Alma Garret</h2>
        <h3>Played by Molly Parker</h3>
        <p>
          Thirty and beautiful, Alma Garret married after the panic of 1873 to
          salvage her father's strained finances. Preferring a fool's errand to
          the circumstances of New York society, she came west with her husband,
          Brom, to prospect, a woolly situation she softened with liberal use of
          laudanum.
